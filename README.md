# XoX Game

Welcome to the XoX Game repository! This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XoX) game developed using the Godot Engine 4.0.

This is the public repository of the game that is also available in [Itch.io](https://studioabs.itch.io/xox-tic-tac-toe)
This game was created after following the tutorial of [Coding with Russ](https://youtu.be/w6leMEr1aGo?si=Nf3qPM6xpXZAQfRB)
This is the code repo of the video on Youtube by [A.B.S Studio]()

You can "Borrow" the code as I also "borrowed" but modified the code a little bit.
