# XoX Game

Welcome to the XoX Game repository! This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XoX) game developed using the Godot Engine 4.0.

This is the public repository of the game that is also available in <ion-icon name="game-controller-outline"></ion-icon>

You can "Borrow" the code as I also "borrowed" but modified the code a little bit.
