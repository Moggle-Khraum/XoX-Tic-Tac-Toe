# XoX Game

Welcome to the XoX Game repository! This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XoX) game developed using the Godot Engine 4.0.

This is the public repository of the game that is also available in ![Itch.io](![itch-io-icon-2048x2048-i6hzclad])[https://studioabs.itch.io/xox-tic-tac-toe].

You can "Borrow" the code as I also "borrowed" but modified the code a little bit.
